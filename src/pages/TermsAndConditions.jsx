            Charges and Fees in respect of Pro Services: ❖ In respect of Pro

            required to pay Service Professionals the amount indicated at the
            time of booking as well as amounts towards (a) any additional Pro

            of goods required or utilized for the performance of the Pro Service
            (“Charges”). In addition to the Charges payable to Service
            Professionals, Rehaabit reserves the right to charge you a
            convenience fee for facilitating the booking and transferring
            payments to the Service Professional (this fee is referred to as
            “Fees”). You acknowledge that the final bill you receive may include
            additional charges, including without limitation, a safety fee,
            warranty fee, insurance fee, or Service Professional welfare fee. ❖
            Rehaabit shall notify you of the applicable Charges, Fees, and
            payment methods at the time of booking. Generally, you may make
            payments for Pro Services through credit cards, debit cards, net
            banking, wallets, UPI or cash upon completion of the Pro Service. We
            have the right to modify and otherwise restrict the modes of payment
            available to you. You acknowledge that certain payment methods such
            as cash upon completion may not always be available to you as a
            payment method. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event you pay
            through the method of ‘cash upon completion’, you acknowledge that
            you will be required to pay both Charges and Fees to the Service
            Professional. ❖ The Charges and Fees may be payable at the time of
            making a booking, or upon the completion of the Pro Service, as
            specified by Rehaabit. ❖ For the avoidance of doubt, please note
            that the Charges are payable to Service Professionals, and Rehaabit
            acts as a limited collection agent on behalf of such Service
            Professionals to collect and transfer amounts due to them. ❖ Taxes:
            All Charges and Fees are inclusive of applicable taxes. ❖ Rehaabit
            reserves the right to reasonably amend the Charges and Fees at any
            time at its sole discretion. A change in Fees shall not impact any
            bookings that have been confirmed before the publication of the
            revised Fees on the Platform. ❖ Charges and Fees that you pay are
            final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Rehaabit or
            required by the applicable laws. Under certain laws, you may be
            entitled to a refund or other remedies for a failure in the
            provision of the Services. ❖ You acknowledge and agree that Charges
            and Fees applicable in certain geographical areas may increase
            substantially during times of high demand. Rehaabit will use
            reasonable efforts to inform you of the Charges and Fees that may
            apply. However, by using the Pro Services or Services, you will be
            responsible for the Charges and Fees incurred under your Account
            regardless of your awareness of such Charges or Fees.

            policies of such Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We
            shall not be liable for any error of the Payment Processor. In the
