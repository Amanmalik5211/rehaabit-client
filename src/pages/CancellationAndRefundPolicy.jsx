              1.1 Customer Cancellations
            </h3>
            <p>
              Customers may cancel their order or booking at any time before the
              service is rendered. The cancellation fees are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
              <li>
                <strong>More than 3 hours before the service:</strong> No
                cancellation fee.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Within 3 hours of the service:</strong> A cancellation
                fee of up to â‚¹50 may apply. No fee if a professional is not
                assigned.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-2">
              The cancellation fee goes directly to the professional. Their time
              is reserved for the service, and they cannot accept another job
              for the reserved time.

            <p>
              If a service provider cancels the order, the customer will be
              notified and offered the option to reschedule the service with
              another available service provider or receive a full refund.
